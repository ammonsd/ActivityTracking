  - Links preserve authentication and provide unified experience across both UIs

### General Features

- 🎯 **Dynamic dropdown management** for clients, projects, phases, and expense types (accessible via React Admin Dashboard)
- ✔️ Data validation and error handling
- 📚 Comprehensive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.7 (MVC + Thymeleaf), Spring Data JPA
- **Frontend:** Angular 19, Angular Material, TypeScript, Chart.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+
- **Storage:** AWS S3 (production) / Local file system (development) for receipt storage
- **API Documentation:** Springdoc OpenAPI 2.7.0 (Swagger UI)
- **Build:** Maven, npm
- **Testing:** JUnit 5 (290+ tests), Testcontainers, Karma/Jasmine
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS ECS (optional)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or Docker)

### Database Setup

The application automatically creates tables and populates initial data on startup. The database includes:

**Tables:**

- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `taskactivity` - Time tracking records
- `dropdownvalues` - Dynamic dropdown values for clients, projects, phases, and expense types
- `expenses` - Expense records with approval workflow

**Initial Data:**

- Default admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)
- Sample clients, projects, and phases
- Expense types (travel, meals, office supplies, etc.)
- Expense statuses (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Reimbursed)
- Payment methods and receipt statuses

⚠️ **Security:** Change the default admin password immediately after first login!

**Built-in Security Features:**

- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed login attempts locks account (admin can unlock)
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 authentication requests per minute per IP address
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based API authentication with configurable expiration
- **JWT Token Revocation**: Server-side token blacklisting on logout and password change
- **File Upload Security**: Magic number validation prevents malicious file uploads (JPEG/PNG/PDF signatures verified)
- **Password Security**: Password hashes removed from debug logs, BCrypt hashing
- **Docker Secrets**: Production uses secrets for all sensitive credentials
- **Disabled by Default**: Swagger UI and detailed Actuator endpoints require explicit enablement

### Run Locally

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ammonsd/ActivityTracking.git
cd ActivityTracking

# Run with Maven
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

# Or run with Docker
docker-compose --profile host-db up -d
```

Access the application at **http://localhost:8080**

### Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

**Security (Required):**

```bash
# JWT authentication configuration
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)  # Generate secure 256-bit key
export APP_ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD="YourSecure123!Pass"  # Min 12 chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars

# Database credentials
export DB_USERNAME="your_db_user"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_db_password"
```

**Optional JWT Customization:**

```bash
export JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000        # Access token lifetime in ms (default: 24 hours)
export JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION=604800000  # Refresh token lifetime in ms (default: 7 days)
```

⚠️ **Security Note:** The application will fail to start if `JWT_SECRET` is not set or uses an insecure default value.

#### Receipt Storage Configuration

The application supports two storage backends for expense receipts:

**Local File Storage (Development):**

```properties
# In application.properties or application-local.properties
storage.type=local
storage.local.base-path=./receipts
```

**AWS S3 Storage (Production):**

```properties
# In application.properties or application-aws.properties
storage.type=s3
storage.s3.bucket-name=your-bucket-name
storage.s3.region=us-east-1
```

For AWS deployment, ensure:

- S3 bucket is created with appropriate permissions
- ECS task role has S3 read/write permissions
- See [AWS Deployment Guide](aws/AWS_Deployment.md) for complete setup

### API Documentation

⚠️ **Security Note:** Swagger UI is **disabled by default** for security. To enable for development/testing:

```properties
# In application-local.properties or set environment variable
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
springdoc.api-docs.enabled=true
```

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI when enabled:

- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
